# Singly Linked List
 Create a prototype function for finding the nth value from the end of a linked list
## Challenge
Create a function prototype to locate the nth from the end of the linked list
## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of minimizing big O space/time by keeping my functions simplistic and focused on only what was necessary to complete the task. Big O space is O(1) and time is O(n);
## API
.insert();

Insert a node at the beginning of a linked list

.include();

Search for a value in a linked list and return true or false
.toString()

Output a string of the contents of a linked list
.append()

Add a node to the end of the linked list with a specified value
.insertBefore()

Insert a node with a given value before a specified node
.insertAfter()

Insert a node with a given value after a specified node;
.kthFromEnd() A function that finds the value kth from the end of the linked list
