# Trees
Javascript implementation of the Trees data structure

Â 
Using a breadth-first strategy, traverse the input tree

## Challenge
browsing and adding in bi search trees using a recursive method

## Approach & Efficiency
approach: recursion
Efficiency:
space: O(h) for all methods where h is the height of the tree
time: O(n) for all methods where is the number of nodes
