# Array binary search
search for a value inside an array using the binary search method

## Challenge
achieving this without using built in functions

## Efficiency and Approach
Create a while loop that matches the middle point of the array value, and if there is no match, there are two cases:
1- The value is greater than the midpoint=> the second half of the array is midway

2- The value below the midpoint=> matches the midpoint of the array's first half.
