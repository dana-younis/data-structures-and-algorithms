# Stacks and Queues
Stack is data structure that follows LIFO approach
Queue is Abstract Data Type (ADT) that follows FIFO approach

## Challenge
To implement stack and queue form scratch and develop them as a singly linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
I developed the stack and queue following Single Linked List, and all the methods were Time complexity O(1)

## API

#### STACK
`push(val)` ---> to add value to the top of the stack with time complexity of O(1).
`pop()` ---> to remove value from the top of the stack, and return the removed value, and raise error if the stack is empty
`peek()` ---> to check and return the top value of the stack and raise an error if the stack is empty.
`isEmpty()` --> to check if the stack empty and return boolean.


#### Queue
`enqueue` ---> to add value to the end of the queue with time complexity of O(1).
`dequeue()` ---> to remove value from the front of the queue, and return the removed value, and raise error if the queue is empty.
